Emacs config thoughts.

I like Emacs Live a lot.  So much that I keep getting tempted not to
bother with developing my own config and just customizing Sam's.  But
I'm put off by the branding and by being dependent on waiting for him to
update stuff.  I don't want to submit pull requests or fork.  I don't
want to have to turn off his splash screen and then feel bad about it.
The packs are well structured, maybe too well structured.  Too
frameworky.  So I want to study his work, but not use it directly.

El-Get.  I'm a little freaked out by the whole security bit.
Downloading code off a wiki and executing it seems, frankly, crazy.
It's unclear to me how to know what version anything is at.  Again, too
frameworky.  I'd rather just vendor & submodule stuff and track it using
git submodules.  If I need to fork, just submodule my fork.  Gives me
ownership and better visibility into what is going on.

So no, no El-Get either.  Maybe just for discovery of new stuff.
